## 1. Have a budget

Ask yourself, how much am I willing to invest right now.

You can't be planning to buy land in Lekki when the money in your account is calling you to Ikorodu.

## 2. What's your reason for investing?

Decide your reason for investing. Are you investing for cashflow or huge capital gains in the future?

When you understand this, it will determine what you will invest in.

## 3. Now decide what you want to invest in.
 
If you have decided to invest for capital gains, then you might decide to buy land in developing areas with potential for appreciation; somewhere like Ibeju-Lekki.

If you are investing for cashflow, then you might want to buy an apartment and put it up for rent.

You get the point?

## 4. Pick a location
: Once you have decided what you want to invest in, you now have to decide on location.

If you're looking to buy land for capital gains, then you should be looking at areas that obviously have potential for appreciation.

If you're looking to invest for rental cash flow for instance, then you should be looking to invest in an area that has high rental value.

## 5. Who am I buying from
The importance of this cannot be over emphasized. 

You want to make sure you are buying from the right source, a major part of buying from the right source is conducting proper due diligence before making a commitment.

I hope this helps you.
