<h2 id="1-have-a-budget">1. Have a budget</h2>

<p>Ask yourself, how much am I willing to invest right now.</p>

<p>You can‚Äôt be planning to buy land in Lekki when the money in your account is calling you to Ikorodu.</p>

<h2 id="2-whats-your-reason-for-investing">2. What‚Äôs your reason for investing?</h2>

<p>Decide your reason for investing. Are you investing for cashflow or huge capital gains in the future?</p>

<p>When you understand this, it will determine what you will invest in.</p>

<h2 id="3-now-decide-what-you-want-to-invest-in">3. Now decide what you want to invest in.</h2>

<p>If you have decided to invest for capital gains, then you might decide to buy land in developing areas with potential for appreciation; somewhere like Ibeju-Lekki.</p>

<p>If you are investing for cashflow, then you might want to buy an apartment and put it up for rent.</p>

<p>You get the point?</p>

<h2 id="4-pick-a-location">4. Pick a location</h2>
<p>: Once you have decided what you want to invest in, you now have to decide on location.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre looking to buy land for capital gains, then you should be looking at areas that obviously have potential for appreciation.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre looking to invest for rental cash flow for instance, then you should be looking to invest in an area that has high rental value.</p>

<h2 id="5-who-am-i-buying-from">5. Who am I buying from</h2>
<p>The importance of this cannot be over emphasized.</p>

<p>You want to make sure you are buying from the right source, a major part of buying from the right source is conducting proper due diligence before making a commitment.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you.</p>
